0. git remote add origin https://github.com/gitktlee88/GitHub-Test.git
 !! 
 !! git config --local
    git config --global
    git config --list
 


1. git push -f origin master
 !! Beware Github noobs... it'll remove all in Github repo.
    This is happen when you try to push initially.
    Because in your GitHub repo have readMe.md or any other 
    new thing which is not in your local repo. 

    First you have to merge unrelated history of your github repo.
    To do that ...
2. git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
 !!
